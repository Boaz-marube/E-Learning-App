# Educational AI Graph System

This folder contains the core components of our educational AI assistant, built using LangGraph to create an intelligent tutoring system that adapts to both students and instructors. The system features robust error handling, centralized LLM management, and comprehensive educational routing.

## Overview

The system uses a graph-based architecture where each component handles a specific educational task. Students get personalized learning experiences, while instructors receive tools for content creation and student analytics. The system gracefully handles failures and provides consistent, reliable educational assistance.

## Architecture

```
Student Flow:
Query → Router → Retriever → Generator → Synthesizer → Response
   ↓ (with error handling at each step)
Error Handler → Fallback Response

Instructor Flow:
Query → Router → Generator → Analytics/Assessment → Synthesizer → Response
   ↓ (with error handling at each step)
Error Handler → Fallback Response
```

## Core Components

### `state.py` - System State Management
Defines the shared state structure that flows through all components:
- User identification and roles (student/instructor)
- Learning progress and difficulty levels
- **request_type**: Reserved parameter for future advanced routing (currently unused)
- Conversation context and routing decisions
- Document retrieval results and generated content
- Error tracking and recovery information

### `llm_config.py` - Centralized LLM Management
**NEW**: Single source of truth for all LLM configurations:
- **Centralized Configuration**: One place to manage all LLM settings

## Usage Examples

### Student Interaction with Error Handling
```python
# Student asks about a concept
state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is a Python function?")],
    "user_type": "student",
    "student_level": "beginner",
    # request_type reserved for future use
}

# System flow with error handling:
# 1. Input validation ✓
# 2. Router → Retriever → Generator → Synthesizer
# 3. Error recovery at each step if needed
# Result: Beginner-friendly explanation with curriculum context
```

### Instructor Interaction with Resilience
```python
# Instructor needs teaching materials
state = {
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Create a quiz on loops")],
    "user_type": "instructor",
    # request_type: "quiz_generation" (reserved for future)
}

# System flow with error handling:
# 1. Input validation ✓
# 2. Router → Generator → Synthesizer
# 3. Fallback strategies if LLM/RAG fails
# Result: Professional quiz with curriculum alignment
```

### Error Scenario Examples
```python
# Empty input handling
state = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="")]}
# Result: "I didn't receive any input from you. Could you please ask me a question?"

# RAG system failure
# ChromaDB unavailable → System continues with general knowledge
# "I'm having trouble accessing the learning materials right now..."

# LLM rate limit hit
# Automatic retry with delays: 5s → 10s → 15s
# Final fallback: "I'm experiencing high demand, please try again in a moment"
```
